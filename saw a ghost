...
the clock it taunts me
tells me i should be
30 thousand feet in the air
but i'm only 6 feet
still drowning in the thought
i'll never be enough
looking at myself and thinking
he doesn't deserve your love
...i can't escape the feeling
i'm not human
its just a subliminal act

i think i'm losing my mind
working overtime
'till my heartbeat stops on a dime

   i think i saw a ghost
   staring right back at me through the mirror
   they're reaching through my soul
   as i dissociate the feeling of feeling again
nostalgic memories... of my past haunt me at night
while nightmares of my future... possess my mind

i'm staring at these walls
think i might go insane
how can i feel something?
when nothings felt the same
i guess its wishful thinking
that i could live a life
without the torment of my demons and their knives
...
i'm overthinking my whole life
'till the point i feel numb inside
but i'm still an emotional softie
can't handle it when i cry
i get overwhelmed wwith emotions
feels like i'm lost with motion
i'll live my life in la vie en noir
dasant avec les morts

    i think i saw a ghost
    staring back at me through the mirror
    don't recognize myself
    as I dissociate the feeling of feeling again
