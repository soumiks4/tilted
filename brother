Ooh ooh...
Sleep now
under my skin

make sure you'll try to conjure the wind 
and ease my mind
ooh ...oh
somebody call out to your brother
He's calling out your name

hiding under the covers with no one else to blame
you couldn't help out your own neighbour
you couldn't tell it to his face
you were fucked up by the blame
you cower in the corner!
confide in your father
let it out and say
let it pass away

sleep now udnder my skin
make sure you try to conjure the wind
and ease my mind
and i say.. ooh

somebody call out to your brother
He's calling out your name
hiding under the covers with no one else to blame
you couldn't help out your own neighbour
you couldn't tell it to his face
you were fucked up by the blame
you cower in the corner
confide in your father
let it out and say

you cower in the corner
confide in your father
let it break your day
let it out and say

wait there
pull yourself out of this state dear
acknowledge you were fake here 
from there on you might just grow
