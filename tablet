There, under a moonlit sky, investigating towers with their wires twined
Hair, glowing a blonde, yellow shine, looks down upon my figure on a windy night
And now, it’ll hide away in filth and the endless waste
Although it rains, it always stays

There, showing a grin so wide, is Venus wrecking everything that’s good and kind
Still showing her big, round eyes that never understood what is evil and right
And now, seeming well-behaved, see the mad devil start to sway
I know you’ll dance away until you’re bored and drained

The red tablets liked to melt, right
They filled up the air in due time, always with the scent of blood in the sky

Falling so deeply while clinging to love
But even so, I feel my heart and it’s floating up above
Your true face, such a passionate one, shows your beauty, coming in a flood
True, all of our short-lived youth will someday come to end
Ah, even so, in my view, it starts right now, yet again

Here, everything’s dull and dry, but life is never over till the day you die
Now all of the screams and cries I heard that time will always sound within my mind
It’s like my head is all aflame now, hot and burned out
They’re gone and can’t be found, those things I always cared about

Within the night, the shot of a gun hides
When it went and pierced through my chest at that time, all I knew was I felt purely alive

Still my heart beats again and again
I’m always searching for a love with no sense within my head
Till that day, when I see that I’ve met the most amazing demon ever yet
Hey, never forget my face, the fact that I remain
Ah, how ‘bout a movie date? Let’s go there tomorrow, okay?

Oh please, just look hard and think deep
Think and dream that you’ll be so strong, indeed
Let us leave control that won’t cease and believe we can both be free

Oh please, just look hard and think deep
Think and dream that you’ll be so strong, indeed
Let us leave control that won’t cease and believe we can both be free

Falling so deeply while clinging to love
But even so, I feel my heart and it’s floating up above
Your true face, such a passionate one, shows your beauty, coming in a flood
True, all of our short-lived youth will someday come to end
Ah, even so, in my view, it starts right now, yet again

And every day, I found I prayed for you to be always full of happiness that remains
Ah, just like this, please wait right by my side, please stay
