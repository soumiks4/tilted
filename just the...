i see the crystal raindrops fall and the beauty of it all
is when the sun comes shining through
to make those rainbows in my mind when I think of you sometime
and I wanna spend some time with you
      just the two of us, we can make it if we try... just the two of us
      just the two of us, building castles in the sky... just the two of us
you and i

we look for love, no time for tears, wasted water all that is
and they don't make no flowers grow
good things might come to those who wait
not to those who wait too late
we gotta go for all we know

i Hear the crystal raindrops fall on the window down the hall
and it becomes the morning dew
darlin' when the morning comes and i see the morning sun
i want to be the one with you

just the two of us
