Now I find I’m left behind around the world, as if they’re blind
And inside, I felt like I was just a horrid sight
Though it’s seized ‘fore errors leak from all those thirty-something thieves
In just three rolls only, the little dog is solely very lonely

Wonder how fast you’ll go with speed
Moving forward with your feet
Until it seems you’ve lost your head and fallen deep

Look at this place, what’s wrong inside?
Look at my brain, what’s wrong this time?
I really thought I lost my own mind

Highbrow, brainy rendezvous
A strong and spoiled place to run through
Although your shout grew, go on and laugh too
All while you’re living, start new

Highbrow, brainy rendezvous
A sort of haughty place to run through
Although your shout grew, go on and laugh too
All while you’re living, start new

Wonder how fast you’ll go with speed
Moving towards the love you seek
Until it seems you’ve lost your head and fallen deep

Look at this place, what’s wrong inside?
Look at my brain, what’s wrong this time?
I really thought I lost my own mind

Highbrow, brainy rendezvous
A really laid bare place to run through
Although your shout grew, go on and laugh too
All while you’re living, start new

Highbrow, brainy rendezvous
A sort of haughty place to run through
Although your shout grew, go on and laugh too
All while you’re living, start new
